program to simulate single-processor scheduling algorithms. 

interprets command-line inputs to specify the algorithm and process details, using a dynamic event handling system synchronized with a simulated clock. processes are managed efficiently through various states until completion, with detailed tracking of service and turnaround times. the program supports multiple algorithms, including First-Come, First-Serve, Highest Response Ratio Next, and Feedback
